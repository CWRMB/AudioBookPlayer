Android application that displays books with the author in a recycler view. When clicked the title and author will display in a fragment.
The fragments data is transmitted through a live data object that is observed. This means we can retain data information with orientation and state changes
to our activity. Our application also has different xml files and fragments for landscape mode and portrait mode.
