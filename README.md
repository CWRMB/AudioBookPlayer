# 3515-Assignment-10
This branch expands off of assignment 9. This app now will write and read files. This means the book is downloaded simultaneously while streaming. The progress and book list searched is also saved via object file writing. These are recovered when possible.

For visuals refer to assignment-9 since the layout has remained the same. Only the background functionality has changed in this assignment.
